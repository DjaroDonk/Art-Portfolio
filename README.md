# My Art Portfolio
Art that I made either for fun or to be used in my games. Mostly pixel art, because that's all I can do, but if I ever end up learning vector art or 3d modelling or something like that, I'll surely add it here as well.

# Jumping Slime

This is actually the first pixel art animation I ever made. (Well, technically I have "animated" sprites which can be considered "pixel art" before, but all I ever did was rotate characters' legs back and forth, which can hardly be called animation.)

# Alien with no upper body
![alien big](nolegalien.png)  
Can you believe it? This alien lacks an upper body! It's just a head on legs. I tried seriously drawing a whole body, but then this ended up being its shape, so I decided to just go with it! 
The top is yellow because the palette I was using didn't have a lighter shade of green, looking back I really probably should've added my own shade of green instead of using yellow. Palettes are great but if it doesn't have the colour you want then you should just add your own colour.
